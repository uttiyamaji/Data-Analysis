# Data Analysis

Organising some of the datasets and codes I have used in the past in one place. These are mostly incomplete. 

## __Zomato data Analysis__ : 

dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data?select=zomato.csv
##### Building a predictive model to predict whether a restaurant is rated more than 4 (subject to change) or not.
- Pre-processing, mainly the cuisines feature
- Univariate feature selection 
- SVM 
##### Visualizing in lower dimension to see if there is any pattern
- MDS, isomap, LLE

## Tidy Tuesday:
Attempting Tidy Tuesday problems using Python to develop data wrangling skills in Python
- penguins

  - Exploration using facet wraps
  - Modeling to predict the Penguin species using Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Avatar

  - Generating various text features to predict whether a line was spoken by any character or it was a scene description
  - textfeatures: https://pypi.org/project/textfeatures/

## Regression Analysis Course Project:
- link to the Exploratory data analysis: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/readme.md 
- After exploration a linear model was fit using backward elimmination

## __IMDB__ :
Exploring what makes the IMDB rating high for a film with a dataset of ~5k films. The dataset contains a lot of nice variables. Another similar dataset, containing data about ~80k films is there. 

## __random__:
some miscelleneous data analyses
##### MachineHack:
Participated in one hackathon, prediction of video games sales, didn't complete and submit though
##### __mess_bill_analysis__: 
Analysed the mess bill I had for a month
##### __Credit__:  
Tried various piecewise linear modelling techniques
