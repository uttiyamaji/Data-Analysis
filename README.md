# Data Analysis

Organising some of the datasets and codes I have used in the past in one place. These are mostly incomplete. 

## __Zomato data Analysis__ : 
Exploring a dataset scraped from zomato (downloaded from kaggle <add link>) to understand relationships between the average price for two, rating, cuisines it serve, location etc. 
Although the dataset actually contains data from all over the world, but a subset which contains more than 5k restaurents from Delhi has been used.
Pre-processing this dataset is important before making models from it

## __IMDB__ :
Exploring what makes the IMDB rating high for a film with a dataset of ~5k films. The dataset contains a lot of nice variables. Another similar dataset, containing data about ~80k films is there. 

## __random__:
some miscelleneous data analyses
##### __mess_bill_analysis__: 
Analysed the mess bill I had for a month
##### __Credit__:  
Tried various piecewise linear modelling techniques
