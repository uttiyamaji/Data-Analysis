# Data Analysis

Organising some of the datasets and codes I have used in the past in one place. These are mostly incomplete. 

## __Zomato data Analysis__ : 

##### Visualizing in lower dimension 
- MDS
- LLE
- Isomap 

##### Building a predictive model to predict whether a restaurant is rated more than 4(subject to change) or not.
The main feature is the _cuisines_ it serve, other features include the _location_(lat,long), _Average price for two_ etc. 
- Proper pre-processing 
- Univariate feature selection 
- Plotting in 2D using MDS 
- Tuning SVM (kernel = 'rbf')

## __IMDB__ :
Exploring what makes the IMDB rating high for a film with a dataset of ~5k films. The dataset contains a lot of nice variables. Another similar dataset, containing data about ~80k films is there. 

## __random__:
some miscelleneous data analyses
##### MachineHack:
Participated in one hackathon, prediction of video games sales, didn't complete and submit though
##### __mess_bill_analysis__: 
Analysed the mess bill I had for a month
##### __Credit__:  
Tried various piecewise linear modelling techniques
