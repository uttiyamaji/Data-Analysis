# Data Analysis

Organising some of the datasets and codes I have used in the past in one place. These are mostly incomplete. 

## __Zomato data Analysis__ : 
Exploring a dataset scraped from zomato (downloaded from kaggle, <add link>) to understand relationships between the average price for two, rating, cuisines it serve, location etc. 
Although the dataset actually contains data from all over the world, but a subset which contains more than 5k restaurents from Delhi has been used
